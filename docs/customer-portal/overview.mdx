The Customer Portal is a space for agency customers to see details about their automations as easy and accessible as possible, keeping it simple and intuitive, without having to view flows.
Its aim is empowering agencies to seamlessly invite customers to projects while providing a sleek, user-friendly portal for them, without the need to view flows.
The Portal is composed of two pages:

1. **Activity**: Includes a table where customers would be able to get the latest updates about their automations.
2. **Connections**: A page where customers can add/remove their connections that are used in automations built by the agency.
